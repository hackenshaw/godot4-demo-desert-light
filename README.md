# Desert Light - A Godot 4 demo (modified for macOS)
This is a short demo and test for the Global Illumination (Voxel Gi) and Volumetric Fog. This forked version has xome modifications in the render settings to make it run decently on my M1 MacbookPro. (Not tested on any other hardware)

## What to do with this demo‚ùì
### Running the executable directly
- You can download and run the current build directly from the releases section (I only build Windows + Linux. Sorry Mac, I got no love for you üíÄ) if you just want to check it out in real-time or test the speed on your system.
### Downloading the project
- You can clone / download this repo and have a look in the project. It's not a super crazy complicated thing, but eventually some settings can be interesting.
### Contribute
- If you have the feeling that something is missing or if there is a bug, feel invited to open an issue or PR.
- If it is a PR that would change the visuals, please contact me before you start working on it! (**Discord: Picster#0001**)
- **If it is a visual bug or glitch and you have the feeling it is a rendering / engine problem, I would ask you to open an issue in the [Godot Engine GitHub issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) directly.**


## Performance üå†
If you experience performance problems, you can try changing the graphics settings in the menu (<kbd>ESC</kbd> -> Settings). If this does not help, I'm afraid there is nothing I can do for you. This is a pretty high-end demo when it comes to what Godot 4 can do (although, I use no textures or complicated materials / shaders).
